# Programming Logic Exercises

This repository contains basic programming logic exercises developed during my studies in Systems Analysis and Development.

The goal of these exercises is to strengthen my understanding of:

- Conditional structures
- Repetition structures
- Variables and data types
- Logical reasoning

These programs were developed using Visualg as part of my foundational learning process.

I am continuously improving my programming skills and will be updating this repository with new projects.
